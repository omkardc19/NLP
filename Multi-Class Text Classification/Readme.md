#Text Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes

##Overview:

This document provides a guide on how to train a text classification model using Multinomial Naive Bayes and apply it to new text data for label prediction.

##Methodology:

###1.Loading the Data:

· Read the training data from 'train.csv' using pandas.

· Explore the dataset to understand its structure.

###2.Text Preprocessing:

· Clean the text data by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and eliminating stopwords.

· Tokenize the text using the NLTK library.

· Utilize CountVectorizer to convert the text into a bag-of-words representation.

###3.Feature Extraction:

· Transform the bag-of-words representation into TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to capture the significance of words.

· Prepare the feature matrix (X) and target variable (Y) for training.

###4.Train-Test Split:

· Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

###5.Model Training:

· Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier using the training data.

· Evaluate the model on the test set and calculate accuracy.

###6.Testing on New Data:

· Read new text data from 'test.csv.'

· Preprocess the text and transform it into TF-IDF representation using the previously fitted transformers.

· Predict the labels using the trained Naive Bayes model.

##Model Architecture:

· The model architecture is based on the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, a probabilistic classifier suitable for text classification tasks.

· It leverages the bag-of-words representation and TF-IDF transformation for feature extraction.

##Preprocessing Steps:

· Load the necessary libraries, including NLTK and scikit-learn.

· Define a text cleaning function to remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, and eliminate stopwords.

· Apply text cleaning to the training and testing datasets.

· Use CountVectorizer to convert text into a bag-of-words representation.

· Transform the bag-of-words into TF-IDF representation for feature extraction.

##Instructions for Prediction:

###1.Training the Model:

· Execute the provided code for training the Multinomial Naive Bayes model. Ensure the 'train.csv' file is available.

· The model will be trained on the provided dataset, and accuracy metrics will be displayed.

###2.Testing on New Data:

· To predict labels for new text entries (testing on new data), execute the code under the "Testing on new data code" section.

· Ensure the 'test.csv' file is available.

· The model will predict labels for the new data, and accuracy metrics will be displayed.

Follow these instructions to successfully train the model and make predictions on new text data.
